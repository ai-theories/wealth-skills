# Wealth CRM & Meeting Intelligence (`wealth-crm`)

This skill pack equips AI agents (**Claude Code, Devin, Cursor, Antigravity, OpenAI Codex**) to pull decisions and follow-ups out of client meeting notes, shape them into CRM task payloads for an advisor to import, and prepare for client reviews.

---

## When to Activate

Trigger this skill when the user asks to:
- Prepare a pre-meeting briefing pack for an upcoming client review.
- Parse a client meeting transcript or notes and extract key decisions and follow-up action items.
- Structure JSON task payloads for Salesforce FSC, Wealthbox or Practifi.

---

## Engine-Backed Capabilities

| Capability | Engine function | CLI |
|---|---|---|
| Line-level extraction of decisions and action items | `parseMeetingTranscript` | `crm parse-transcript` |
| CRM task payload construction (not sent) | `buildCrmPayload` | library only |

## Guidance Only (No Engine Support)

- Pre-meeting briefing packs and relationship intelligence
- Sending, syncing or reading data from any CRM

## Limits to State With Every Result

- Extraction is whole-word keyword matching. Review the extracted items against the transcript before creating tasks; it will miss follow-ups phrased without its keywords.
- Payloads are generic task JSON labelled with the target platform. Map them to the CRM's actual API before importing.

## CLI & Module Usage

```bash
node bin/wealth-skills.js crm parse-transcript --text "Client agreed to rebalance into bonds. Advisor will send proposal next week."
node bin/wealth-skills.js ui render --platform claude --data '{"title":"Meeting Notes","summary":"Rebalance approved"}'
```

```javascript
import { parseMeetingTranscript, buildCrmPayload } from './src/engines/crm.js';

const parsed = parseMeetingTranscript('Client agreed to rebalance.\nAdvisor will send proposal next week.');
const crmPayload = buildCrmPayload('Salesforce_FSC', 'HH-9812', '2026-09-09', parsed.actionItems);
```

---

## Output Standard

Every response MUST format output according to the target platform UI specifications ([`docs/UI_TEMPLATES.md`](../../docs/UI_TEMPLATES.md)) and include the `auditMetadata` block returned by the tool:
1. **Claude**: Use Artifact cards, GitHub Alerts (`> [!NOTE]`), and GFM tables.
2. **OpenAI Codex & Canvas**: Output structured JSON payloads and standard Markdown tables.
3. **Cursor & VS Code**: Output code diffs for CRM payload updates.
